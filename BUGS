- Can't locate object method "assign" via package "Module-Maintain"
  (perhaps you forgot to load "Module-Maintain"?) at
  Module-Template-Setup/lib/Module/Template/Setup.pm line 232.

  Apparently is tries to call something on the module being created??

  Fixed in 0.02 - problem with too many parameters

- There seem to be a problem with CVSTAG:
  [CGI::FastTemplate] Warning: no value found for variable: CVSTAG

  This tag SHOULD be set as default??

  Fixed in 0.02 - problem with configuration conditional
