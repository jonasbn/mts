TODO file for Module-Template-Setup

$Id: TODO,v 1.8 2004-05-15 14:15:04 jonasbn Exp $

- Add handling of configuration file for values

- Add handling of 'personal' templates in $HOME/.mts/templates, meaning
  handling and distinction of both global and local templates

- Add handling of license description via setup.pl (should we change to
  Getopt::Long

- Add AUTHOR file?

- Add LICENSE file?

- Add possibility of adding new templates and removing existing 

- Add possibility of adding new placeholders and default values

- Perhaps the pod.t and pod-coverage.t should not be a part of the 
  distribution (this will also have some impact on the Makefile.PL)
